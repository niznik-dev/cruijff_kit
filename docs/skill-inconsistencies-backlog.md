## High Severity - FIXED

### 1. ~~`inspect.slurm` vs `{task}_epoch{N}.slurm` naming~~ ✅
Fixed in commit 4d9400b

### 2. ~~`run-experiment` workflow documentation incomplete~~ ✅
Fixed in commit 4d9400b

### 3. ~~`config_dir` vs `dataset_path` inconsistent~~ ✅
Fixed in commit 4d9400b - clarified baked values is standard, config_dir is legacy

## Medium Severity - FIXED

### 4. ~~`learning_rate` vs `lr` parameter naming~~ ✅
Added clarifying comment in scaffold-torchtune.md

### 5. ~~`eval_config.yaml` not documented in design-experiment~~ ✅
Added "Files Generated by Downstream Skills" section in experiment_generation.md

### 6. ~~Log file format inconsistency (`.log` vs `.jsonl`)~~ ✅
Added note in scaffold-experiment/logging.md explaining the distinction

### 7. ~~Base model directory creation unclear~~ ✅
Added explicit directory creation example in scaffold-inspect.md

## Skipped (WIP)

### analyze-experiment still references `.md`
**Location:** `.claude/skills/analyze-experiment/SKILL.md` (lines 12, 23, 81, 283)
**Issue:** References `experiment_summary.md` instead of `.yaml`
**Note:** Skipped - someone else will fix this (WIP skill)
