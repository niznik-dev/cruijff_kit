# ðŸŸ¢ Green Tier - Full Access

**Note**: This tier is safe for general use. The experimental warnings for red and yellow tiers do not apply here.

## Access Policy

**Claude Code has FULL ACCESS to all files in this directory and its subdirectories.**

## Purpose

This directory contains data that is safe for AI assistance to read, analyze, and process:

- Synthetic data generated for testing
- Publicly available datasets
- Test fixtures and example data
- Data with no privacy or confidentiality concerns
- Educational datasets
- Generated word lists and bit sequences

## Claude Code Behavior

You may freely:

- Read and analyze files in `data/green/`
- Process and transform the data
- Generate visualizations and statistics
- Use the data for testing and development
- Suggest modifications or improvements

No permission required - these files are explicitly marked as safe for AI access.

## Examples of Green Data

- **Capitalization test data**: Word lists like "apple", "BANANA" for testing capitalization logic
- **Bit sequences**: Binary strings for testing processing pipelines
- **Synthetic social data**: Artificially generated user profiles, responses, etc.
- **Public datasets**: Data from HuggingFace, UCI ML Repository, or other open sources
- **Test fixtures**: Small example files for unit tests
- **Reference data**: Lookup tables, mappings, configuration examples

## For Humans

This is the default location for test data and any data you're comfortable having Claude Code work with directly. If you're generating synthetic data for experiments, this is the right place for it.
